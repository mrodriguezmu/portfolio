# LSTM Forecasting (Advanced ML & Data Science Diploma)

End-to-end time-series forecasting project developed during an advanced Machine Learning & Data Science diploma.
Includes business framing, data loading, exploratory analysis, experimental setup (train/validation strategy), and final modeling.

**What you’ll find**
- Data preparation and feature engineering for time-series inputs
- LSTM model training and hyperparameter tuning (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Evaluation with MAE/MSE across forecasting horizons

**Note:** Datasets are not included
