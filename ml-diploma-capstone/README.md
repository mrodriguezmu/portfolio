# Machine Learning & Data Science Capstone (Python)

Capstone project from a Machine Learning & Data Science diploma program.
Focus on an end-to-end applied ML workflow: data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, tuning, and evaluation.

**What you’ll find**
- Clean, reproducible notebook with the full pipeline
- Supervised ML modeling (classification/regression depending on the dataset)
- Model comparison and evaluation with appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE/MSE or F1/ROC-AUC)

**Note:** Datasets are not included
